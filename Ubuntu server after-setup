On remote after copying rsa.pub key of the local machine, you can add the identiy to the remote authrised

https://phoenixnap.com/kb/setup-passwordless-ssh

There is already a command in the ssh suite to do this automatically for you. I.e log into a remote host and add the public key to that computers authorized_keys file.

ssh-copy-id -i /path/to/key/file user@host.com

If the key you are installing is ~/.ssh/id_rsa then you can even drop the -i flag completely.

Much better than manually doing it!
